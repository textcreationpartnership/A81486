         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Thus you have abundant proof of that darkneſſe which hath been on the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals of Man ſince the Fall, in relation to Gods wonderfull Works: And as our

            <p>Few there be that will give themſelves, or bend all the Faculties of their ſoules to ſtudy and conſider God in his Workes. The <note n="r" place="margin">

            <p>Here may juſtly deſerve blame, the want of Reading, Travelling, and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The want of reading and ſtudying ſuch Authors, as write of the Works of God. <hi>Vita hominis ſine literis mors eſt;</hi> The unlearned is a dying life.</p>
            <p>The Scholer, like a Bee, gathers honey from every flower, knowledg from every Book he touches. Yet <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11. King of <hi>France,</hi> charged his Son to learn no more Latine but this, <hi>Qui neſcit diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare, neſcit vivere;</hi> He that cannot diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and flatter (ſaid he) knows not how to live. When the People <note n="t" place="margin">Aelian.</note> of <hi>Myti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene</hi> became maſters of the Sea, they infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted this puniſhment on thoſe that were revolted from them, <hi>that they ſhould not teach their children to read.</hi> He that is minded to apply himſelf to Reading, ſaith <hi>Seneca,</hi> may have private conference with <hi>Zeno, Pythagoras, Ariſtotle, Theophra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> and other Authors of good Arts; and he ſhall ever finde them at lieſure to commune with him. The want of reading, and learned education, makes people as a barren ſoile, unmanured, unplanted: No
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170492:27"/>marvail ſuch are groſly ignorant of Gods works.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Next, The want of Travelling in ſuch as have Time and Meanes for it. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> ſpeaking of his Travels, would often ſay, that he had diſcovered more with his eye, then other Kings had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in their thoughts. Men do but gueſſe at the works of God abroad, that go meerly by the relations of others. One journey to the Alpes will ſhew thee more then many Hiſtories do record. Let <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> mention it as a point of happineſſe for ones Birth, Life, and Burial to be all in a Pariſh: But how great advantages have thoſe that Travell into divers Nations? How many Rarities of Nature do they ſee? What ſtrange creatures which be not in our Countrey? what craggy Rocks, Mountains aſpiring towards the Sky, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Buildings, goodly Vine-yards, choice and delicate Fruits of the Earth, which our cold Climate affords not; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Antiquities and Monuments of great note; Rare men; the Courts of Princes; the cuſtomes of Nations, &amp;c. Such as go voyages by Sea, muſt needs ſee
<note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 107.24.</note> many wonders of God in the Deep. He hath
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170492:27"/>lived <hi>(ſaith one)</hi> but in a large cheſt, that hath ſeen but one Land. <hi>Italy,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Feltham</hi> Reſolves. Cap. 10.</note> 
               <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> are the Court of the World: <hi>Germany, Denmark</hi> and <hi>China</hi> are as the Citie of the World; The reſt are moſt of them Country and Barbariſme. It were an excellent thing in a State to have a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect number of judicious Perſons, <note place="margin">Note.</note> thus employed into ſeveral parts of the world, and be bound once in ſeven years to give the Nation ſome account of their Travels in writing, for the benefit of ſuch as ſtay at home; and that Penſions might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted for that end. This would be a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter employment for the youth of our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry, then to ruſt at home; Bowl, Dice, and Drink away their golden Time.</p>
            <p>Again, our ignorance of God and his Volumn of Creation, may be charged on the want of Meditation in all men. We ſee divers of Gods works in the pooreſt Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage; but we doe not weigh and ponder them in the Ballance of Meditation. Chriſt therefore <note n="x" place="margin">Mat. 6.26.26.</note> calls upon us to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> the Fowls of the aire, and to <hi>conſider</hi> the Lillies of the field. Wee ſee theſe things, but doe not bend and buckle our
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170492:28"/>minde to the Object, that we conſider the workmanſhip of God in them. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of men <note n="y" place="margin">Job 37.14. Iſa. 5.12.</note> 
               <hi>regard not the works of the Lord, neither conſider the operations of his hands.</hi> They heare it Thunder, but it ſtrikes no awe upon their hearts, becauſe they never conſider it is the voice of God. They heare the whiſtling of the Winde, the ratling of the Hail; Behold the Snow (that feather'd raine) come down, reap benefit by the former and latter rain, but they never conſider of theſe works and wonders of God. When do they, with <hi>Iſaak,</hi> walk into the Fields for meditation, or with <hi>Daniel</hi> by the River ſide, or with <hi>Peter</hi> on the houſe top, to ſurvey &amp; admire God and his works? The love of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation made <note n="z" place="margin">Hieron. Epiſt. 4. <hi>ad Ruſticum.</hi>

               <hi>Cicero</hi> that to think was to live. <hi>Baſil</hi> wept when he handled a Roſe, to conſider the prickles thereof were the fruit of mans Fall. The ſame did <hi>Perſius,</hi> when he ſaw a Toad, to think of his owne ingratitude, in that God had made him a Man, and not a filthy Toad. When <hi>Eſtius</hi> heard the little Birds ſing, O the Muſick, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> that is in Heaven! So when <hi>David (not onely ſaw, but)</hi> well
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170492:28"/>conſidered the Sun, Moon, and Stars, he cryed out, <hi>Lord what is man that thou art mindefull of him?</hi> q. d. That thou ſetteſt up ſuch huge burning Tapors for him that doth ſo little work for thee? Surely, the want of conſidering the choice and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable things which God hath made, is one main reaſon of our knowing them ſo little, and our being affected with them no more.</p>
            <p>To all which conſiderations, let me add the brevity of our Life; <hi>Ars longa, vita brevis:</hi> It requires much time, obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and experience to know the works of God, and our life is fraile and ſhort; as a <hi>Span,</hi> as a <hi>Vapour,</hi> as a <hi>Bubble:</hi> And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times ſaith <hi>Seneca,</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Seneca Epiſt. 23.</note> we begin not to live till our life is ending. Sickneſſe alſo, and old Age ſteal upon us; Then we grow oblivious, unteachable, overcaſt with clouds, full of pain and infirmities.</p>

So red hot iron thruſt into water, will make a very great noiſe. The craſhing and roaring noiſe of Thunder, to what ſhall I compare it? 'Tis like the noiſe of Cheſnuts flying out of the fire; like many Charets and Coaches rumbling and jumping in paved Cities; like many hunger-bitten Lions roaring for their prey; like many roaring Canons diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged one after another; or a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtone tumbling downe a Rock into the Sea.

            <p n="1">1 At the Baptiſme of Chriſt, when the Heavens were opened, (or miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly parted by Thunder) the Dove deſcended, and the voice followed, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed; heare ye him.</hi>

            <p>Thirdly, to this add, <note place="margin">3 Teſtimonies from the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels enemies.</note> that there have been Teſtimonies from the Goſpels e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: <hi>Pulchrum eſt Teſtimonium quo noſtra probantur ab hoſtibus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle.

When Chriſt was at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the midſt of his bitter enemies, aſſembled at the Feaſt of the Paſſeover, and crowding after him, out of novelty to ſee his Miracles;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170492:71"/>Yet <note n="h" place="margin">Iohn 12, 12, 29, 37, 38.</note> when God ſpake to Chriſt from Heaven, this People confeſſed there was THUNDER joyned with the Voice; <hi>John</hi> 12.

            <p>Next, <note n="i" place="margin">Acts 22.1. ad 12.</note> that of <hi>Saul</hi> is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.

            <p>
               <hi>When I was come nigh to Damaſcus, about noon, ſuddenly there ſhone from Heaven a great light, round about me, and I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice ſaying unto me; Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe things were not done private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but were known to the Sanhedrin; and there was company with him on the way. There is a ſeeming difference in the Relations, but the preſent recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling thereof will ſtrengthen our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent obſervation. <note n="l" place="margin">Acts 9.7. &amp; 22.9. reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> One place ſaith, <hi>they stood ſpeechleſſe, heard a voice, but ſaw no man.</hi> Another place ſaith, <hi>They ſaw indeed the light, and were afraid, but they heard not the voice of him that ſpake to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <note n="m" place="margin">Dr <hi>Hamm.</hi> Reaſ.

            <p>The truth of this ſtory St. <hi>Paul</hi> did boldly avow before the Jewes and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, that queſtioned him about his change; He became out of hand, a Preacher, an Apoſtle of the Goſpel, and at length ſealed it with his Blood; For he was beheaded, ſaith <note n="n" place="margin">

A Saint may take occaſion from Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to magnifie and praiſe God, for his power in the Thunder-claps, and for his goodneſſe in their preſervation, who attend his <hi>Temple.</hi> A Believer can with the Pſalmiſt <note n="x" place="margin">Pſalm 148.4.</note> alarm the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Meteors to glorifie God: <hi>Praiſe him Fire and Haile, ſnow and vapours, ſtormy windes fulfilling his will.

               <hi>In a word;</hi> When this goodly frame of Nature ſhall be on fire; Then all true Believers ſhall <hi>lift up their heads, becauſe their Redemption draws nigh.</hi>

            <lg>
               <l>BUt hark what hear I in the Heavens, methinks,</l>
               <l>The Worlds wall ſhakes, and his Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation ſhrinks:</l>
               <l>It ſeems even now that horrible Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phone,</l>
               <l>Looſing Meges, Alecto, and Tyſiphone,</l>
               <l>Weary of reigning in black Erebus,</l>
               <l>Tranſports her Hell between the Heaven and us.</l>
               <l>'Tis held, I know, that when a Vapour moiſt,</l>
               <l>As well from freſh, as from ſalt water hoiſt,</l>
               <l>In the ſame inſtant with hot Exhalations,</l>
               <l>In the airy Regions ſecondary Stations;</l>
               <l>The fiery Fume, beſieged with the crowd</l>
               <l>And keen cold thickneſſe of that dampiſh Cloud,</l>
               <l>Strengthens her ſtrength, and with redoubled vollies,</l>
               <l>Of joyned heate, on the cold Leagher fallies.</l>
               <l>Like as a Lion very late exil'd</l>
               <l>From's native Forreſts; ſpit at, and revilld,</l>
               <l>Mockt, mov'd and troubled with a thouſand toyes,</l>
               <l>By wanton children, idle Girles and Boyes;</l>
               <l>With hideous roaring doth his Priſon fill</l>
               <l>In's narrow Cloiſter, ramping wildly ſtill,</l>
               <l>Runs too and fro; and furious leſſe doth long</l>
               <l>For liberty, then to revenge his wrong:</l>
               <l>This Fire deſirous to break forth again</l>
               <l>From's cloudy Ward, cannot it ſelfe refrain;</l>
               <l>But without reſting loud it groans and grumbles,</l>
               <l>It roules and roars, and round round round it tumbles,</l>
               <l>Till (having rent the lower ſide in ſunder)</l>
               <l>With ſulphry flaſh, it have ſhot down its Thunder.</l>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:170492:109"/>
               <l>Though willing to unite in theſe Alarms</l>
               <l>To's brothers forces his owne fainting Arms,</l>
               <l>And th' hotteſt Circle of the world to gain,</l>
               <l>To iſſue upwards oft is ſtrives in vaine;</l>
               <l>For 'tis there fronted with a Trench ſo large,</l>
               <l>And ſuch an Hoſt, that though it often charge</l>
               <l>On this and that ſide, the cold Camp about</l>
               <l>With his hot skirmiſh; Yet ſtill ſtill the ſtout</l>
               <l>Victorious For repelleth every puſh;</l>
               <l>So that deſpairing, with a furious ruſh,</l>
               <l>Forgetting Honour (which the valiant prize)</l>
               <l>Not as it would, but as it may, it flies.</l>
               <l>Then the Ocean boyls for feare, the Fiſh do deem;</l>
               <l>The Sea too ſhallow to ſafe ſhelter them:</l>
               <l>The Earth doth ſhake; The ſhepheard in the Field,</l>
               <l>In hollow Rocks himſelfe can hardly ſhield.</l>
               <l>Th' affrighted Heav'ns ope, and in the Vale</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Acheron,</hi> grim <hi>Pluto</hi>'s ſelfe looks pale.</l>
               <l>Th' aire flames with fire; for the loud roaring Thunder,</l>
               <l>(Renting the Cloud that it includes aſunder,)</l>
               <l>Sends forth thoſe flaſhes, which ſo blear our ſight:</l>
               <l>As wakefull Students in the winters Night,</l>
               <l>Againſt the ſteel, glauncing with ſtony knocks,</l>
               <l>Strike ſudden ſparks into their Tinder-box.</l>
               <l>Moreover Lightning of a Fume is fram'd</l>
               <l>Through't ſelfs hot drineſſe, evermore inflam'd;</l>
               <l>Whoſe power (paſt credit) without razing skin,</l>
               <l>Can bruiſe to powder all our bones within;</l>
               <l>Can melt the Gold that greedy Mizers hoord,</l>
               <l>In barred cophers, and not burn the boord:</l>
               <l>Can break the blade and never ſinge the ſheath;</l>
               <l>Can ſcorch an Infant in the womb to Death,</l>
               <l>And never blemiſh in one ſort or other,</l>
               <l>Fleſh, bone or ſinew of the amazed Mother:</l>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:170492:110"/>
               <l>Conſume the ſhooes, and never hurt the feet,</l>
               <l>Empty a Cask, and yet not periſh it, &amp;c.</l>
               <l>Methinks I heare when it begins to Thunder,</l>
               <l>The voice that brings Swains up, and Caeſars under:</l>
               <l>By that Tow'r tearing ſtroak I underſtand,</l>
               <l>Th' undaunted ſtrength of the divine right hand;</l>
               <l>When I behold the Lightning in the Skies,</l>
               <l>Methinks I ſee th' Almighties glorious Eyes;</l>
               <l>When I perceive it rain down timely ſhowers,</l>
               <l>Methinks the Lord his Horn of Plenty pours;</l>
               <l>When from the Cloud exceſſive water ſpins,</l>
               <l>Methinks Heaven weeps for our unwept-for ſins.</l>
